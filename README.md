Hello, this is a practice that I have done in programming methodology. You have to unzip the .zip and then you will see 2 things, "decrypt" and "automate".

"Decrypt" basically consists of you entering the number of sentences you are going to enter, and it returns the encrypted code.

"Automata" is a little more complex, this is a Cellular Automata based project. So when you run the code you enter the number you want to get the automata from and their iterations, and it will paint it for you.

They are to run in Bash Shell but they are developed in Dev C++, they are in that format because my teacher asked for it.
